IaaS is the most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. 

**In this mode the cloud provider is responsible for:**
 - Maintaining  the Hardware.
 - Maintaining the network connectivity(to the internet).
 - Physical security.

**The customer is responsible for everything else:**
- Operating system installation.
- Configuration.
- Maintenance.
- Network configuration.
- Database and storage configuration
- And so on.

With IaaS, you're essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you!

### Scenarios where IaaS might make sense include:
- **Lift-and-shift migration:** You're setting up cloud resources similar to your on-premise datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-premise to running on the IaaS infrastructure. 
- **Testing and development:** You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can start or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.
