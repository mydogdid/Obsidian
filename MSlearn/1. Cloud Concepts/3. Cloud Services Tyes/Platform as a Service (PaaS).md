PaaS is a middle ground between the IaaS and the SaaS. In the PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. 

In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases. PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.

Depending on the configuration, you or the cloud provider may be responsible for networking settings and connectivity within your cloud environment, network and application security, and the directory infrastructure.
