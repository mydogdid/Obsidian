A major benefit of cloud computing is the manageability options. 

- ### Management **OF** the cloud:
	Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:
	- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
	- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
	- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
	- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you're aware of performance in real time.

- ### Management IN the cloud:
	Management in the cloud speaks to how you're able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:
	- Through a web Portal.
	- Using a CLI.
	- Using APIs.
	- Using PowerShell.
