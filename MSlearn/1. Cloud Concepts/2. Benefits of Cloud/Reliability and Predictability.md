Two crucial benefits that help you develop solutions with confidence.

- ### Reliability: 
	The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 
	The cloud, by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure. With a decentralized design, the cloud enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world. With this global scale, even if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running. You can design your applications to automatically take advantage of this increased reliability. In some cases, your cloud environment itself will automatically shift to a different region for you, with no action needed on your part.

- ### Predictability:
	Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. It can be focused on **performance predictability or cost predictability**.
	- **Performance:**
		Focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. **Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability** are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.
	- **Cost:** 
		Focuses on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. With the cloud, you can track your resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that you're using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments.
