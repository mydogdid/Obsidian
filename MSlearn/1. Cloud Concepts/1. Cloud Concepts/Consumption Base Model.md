When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider:

- **Capital Expenditure(CapEx):** 
	Typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. Example, a new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter or buying a company vehicle.

- **Operational Expenditure(OpEx):**
	Spending money on services or products over time. Example, renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don't pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. **Instead**, you pay  for the IT resources you use. **If you don't have any IT resources used this month, you don't pay for any IT resources.**

#### Benefits of the consumption-based model:
- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

#### Compare cloud pricing models:
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a **pay-as-you-go pricing model.** You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
- Plan and manage your operating costs.
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
- Scale as your business needs change.

Cloud computing is a way to rent **compute power** and **storage** from someone else's datacenter. You can treat cloud resources like you would resources in your own datacenter. However, unlike in your own datacenter, when you're done using cloud resources, you give them back. **You're only billed for what you use!**
