Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.

## Terms:
- **Compute Power:** How much processing the computer can do. With Cloud computing, we can add or remove as much power as it's needed. This saves on cost, as we only pay for the resources used.

- **Storage:** Volume of data we can store on the computer. With Cloud computing, we can request more storage as its needed. Cloud providers manage the upkeep of the Cloud computer, they will make sure its up and running 24/7 and the system is updated to the latest patches.
